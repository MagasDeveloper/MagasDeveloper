## Hi 👋 I'm Dmytro Mahas  
Unity Developer | Tools & Systems Engineer

I am a Unity Developer with over five years of experience working on both commercial and solo projects.  
My main focus is building reliable development tools, scalable systems, and clean architectures that help teams move faster and maintain long-term project stability.

I specialize in Unity editor tooling, UI systems, performance optimization, and modular system design.  
I enjoy solving structural problems, simplifying complex workflows, and creating developer-friendly solutions that are easy to integrate, understand, and extend.

My background includes working in production environments with live projects, collaborating closely with designers and developers, and maintaining codebases that are actively evolving. I value clarity, predictability, and thoughtful architecture over quick but fragile solutions.
