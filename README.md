## Hi 👋 I'm Dmytro Mahas  

I am a Unity Developer with over five years of experience in both commercial and solo projects, focused on building reliable development tools, scalable systems, and clean architectures.

I specialize in Unity editor tooling, UI systems, performance optimization, and modular design, with a strong interest in simplifying complex workflows and creating developer-friendly solutions.

I have experience working on live projects in production environments, collaborating closely with cross-functional teams, and maintaining evolving codebases. I value clarity, predictability, and long-term maintainability over quick but fragile solutions.

In addition to open-source projects, I also develop <a href="https://localify.carrd.co/"><b>Localify</b></a> — a commercial localization plugin for Unity,
created with care and a strong focus on clean architecture and developer experience.
